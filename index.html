      Robin’s customers experience the rare luxury of having their dream jewelry pieces entirely executed by one master, from elaborating the design,to alloying precious metals, to selecting and setting each stone. Robin works his unparalleled perfection without letting the slightest detail escape his trained eye.<br><br>
For more than 35 years, Robin has created exquisite custom jewelry. His classical training dates back to the Renaissance traditionsof Italian schools of goldsmithing, which are being rapidly replaced by computer-generated mass-production, even amongst the most prominent jewelry houses.His techniques entail hand-forging the metal without the use of wax or casting, an organic system that creates a balance of color, line, and form, giving each jewel a one-of-a-kind life of its own.<br><br>
Robin was introduced into the world of fine jewels by his grandfather, whose exclusive jewelry shop thrived in Los Angeles in the 1920’s and 30’s,and by his father, who continued the family tradition. At an early age, Robin developed a passion for both classical and contemporary art. His love and study of paintings, sculptures, and designs continues to inspire his meticulously crafted work.<br><br>
